<h1>Before We Get Started</h1>
<h2>Finding Your Inner Octave Guitar</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Lurking inside every guitar there is a smaller guitar (minus a string) tuned an octave higher,
      and you'll remember this story every time you go to seventh position,
      and that means for every exercise in this book.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The first guitar I made, at age 15, was a miniature classical guitar tuned an octave higher
      than a standard guitar.  Small suited the situation:
      I had to make it in my bedroom with simple hand tools I had for model airplanes.
      And small also made it unique; you couldn't buy one of these in a store,
      nor could you see one in a museum, much less find design drawings.
      This was back in the 1960s, decades before the internet, so I was on my own.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      But there was one major problem.
      While I could do all the woodworking, there was no way I was going
      to make custom strings.  It wasn't like now, where manufacturers offer
      strings in a continuum of gauges.  And since strings wear out, replacing them with new
      ones was going to be a recurring problem.  Ideally I'd like to use
      strings I could buy at my local music store.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Was there a way to use regular guitar strings in my little guitar?
      Obviously a standard guitar can play an octave higher by going  to the 12th fret,
      but that would make for a tiny half-sized instrument with disproportionately
      thick strings that would be difficult to play and lead to intonation issues.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      A better way to play an octave higher on standard guitar strings is to
      go to the seventh (or eighth) fret on the <i>neighboring</i> string.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Back in those days, well before clip-on electronic tuners,
      everybody tuned one string against its lower neighbor,
      going up 5 frets on the lower string (or up 4 frets on the G string)
      like this:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tunefbV.png">
<p class="norm">
      You knew going up 5 (or 4) frets got you to the next string.  But to get an octave you'd need to
      go up 12 frets.  Well, back then everybody also knew
      that 5 + 7 (or 4 + 8) equaled 12, so going up an additional 7 (or 8) frets
      was an obvious way to play an octave
      above the open lower string, like this:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tunefbVII.png">
<p class="norm">
      That meant I could buy a set of standard classical guitar strings,
      discard the lowest string and get my high E string from a tenor ukulele.
      It would all work if the scale length on my little guitar
      matched about the seventh fret on a standard guitar, like this:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/octave-guitar.png">
<p class="norm">
      The point of telling you this true story about my little octave guitar
      is to plant these images permanently into your brain.  Forevermore you will 
      know that <b>there is an octave guitar on your own fretboard</b> if you just
      move over one string.  The next section shows how to make that knowledge useful.
</p>
<h2>Finding Seventh Position By Ear</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Knowing the octave story will let you find seventh position by ear.
      Put your hand where you guess seventh position is and fret the fifth string
      with your first finger.  If you guessed right, the sound will be exactly an
      octave above the open E string.  If you're wrong, move up or down until
      it's in tune.
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/checkingviifb.png">
<p class="norm">
      You're going to be doing this a lot, and your guesses can actually improve,
      thanks to special neurons in your muscles and joints that allow you
      to sense roughly where your hand is located.  It's called “proprioception”, 
      if you want to read about it in Wikipedia.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      And the point of this section is that you shouldn't <i>look</i> at your hand 
      on the fretboard to find seventh position.  Instead, you should
      <i>feel</i> the fifth string and <i>listen</i> to the result to
      verify that you're in seventh position.  All while keeping your eyes
      on the music.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Remember, \bold <i>your own octave guitar </i> is in seventh position to help you.

<h1>Learn This One Page</h1>
<p class="norm">
      And you'll be able to play every note in this book!
</p>
<h2>The Musical Fretboard Diagram</h2>
<p class="norm">
      This is it. 
      It uses music notation to show notes the way they appear on a staff,
      but the six staves are laid out like the strings of a guitar,
      which, together with the fingertips at the top, show
      what string and finger to use to play each note
      in both seventh position and first.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-blue-e.svg">
<p class="norm">
      For example, it tells you the blue note in seventh position is played
      on string &#9316 (that row) using your first finger (that column),
      same as you just learned from the ordinary fretboard diagram in the previous section
      on Finding Seventh Position By Ear.
      But here you get to see what that note looks like on the staff 
      (it's on the lowest line)
      so you can recognize it when sightreading.
</p>
<h2>Virtual Fretboard Stickers</h2>
<p class="norm">
      This diagram is not music for you to sightread.
      It's a visual map of the fretboard, labeled by the notes themselves,
      just like you'll see when sightreading.
      For the blue note above, the label is 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineE.svg">
 instead of the <b>E</b>
      in ordinary fretboard diagrams.
      You can see how to play that 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineE.svg">
 by where it is placed in the diagram.
      It's like having a little 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineE.svg">
 sticker on your fretboard,
      except you're never looking at the real fretboard again.
      <i>You just look at the musical fretboard diagram and press the virtual sticker for the note you want to play, </i>
      i.e. you finger the real guitar where the virtual sticker is in the diagram.
      Soon you won't even be looking at the diagram on the page;  
      you'll be seeing it in your mind's eye as a lasting visual memory.
</p>
<h2>Your First Note in Two Positions</h2>
<p class="norm">
      You've learned the blue note as the way to find seventh position.
      Good, we'll keep that association. But now we want a special note
      that will remind you that all the notes in this book are playable in two positions.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      That special note's sticker is 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
 which stands out visually as the note
      with a line through it just below the staff.  It also has a special name,
      “middle C”, from being in the middle of a piano keyboard and being
      midway between the treble and bass clefs. Actually, when played on guitar
      it sounds an octave lower than the piano's middle C, but that's just
      a convient convention so guitarists don't have to learn the bass clef.
      It's also special because it's the “root” of the major scale for the natural notes.
      The “Do” in “Do, Re, Me”.  So we give it the special color red:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-red-mdlc.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Look at the diagram and ask yourself how would you play that red note, 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
,
      in seventh position.  Imagine that diagram as a guitar neck
      where you can reach around to the sixth string and use your middle
      finger to play the red note.  Press the 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
 sticker while
      you imagine plucking the sixth string.  Can you visualize doing that?
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Now do the same visualization in first position.  Imagine sliding
      your left hand down the neck to the left part of the diagram
      until your first finger is just below the first fret.
      Looking at the diagram, imagine playing the red note that position.
      Which finger would you use, on which string?
      Should be your third finger on the fifth string.
      Touch that third finger to your thumb and press just like
      you're fretting the note.
      Press hard while your eyes are still focused on the 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
 sticker.
      Feel like you're playing that sticker.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Let the red note remind you of this visualization experience
      of playing the same sounding note, 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
, in two positions.
      Going forward, you'll be focusing on other stickers
      like 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineG.svg">
 without any colors to guide you, but the idea
      of two ways to play each note should still be there. Right?
</p>
<h2>Noodling the Diagram</h2>
<p class="norm">
      It's time to get out your guitar and explore playing some random notes
      from the musical fretboard diagram.  Put your hand in seventh position without looking
      at the real fretboard (remember the blue note?).  Now look at seventh position in the diagram
      and choose a note at random.  Focus on its “sticker” while you interpret
      where that sticker is located in the diagram, i.e. which finger slot
      is it in, and on which string.  While still focusing on that sticker,
      move that finger to that string and really play the note on your guitar.
      Choose another note and repeat until you feel comfortable
      interpreting the diagram as a guide to playing whatever note you choose to look at.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      After noodling around in seventh position, do the same in first position.
      You don't have to do the same random notes you did before; just explore
      what it's like to find and play notes in first position
      while looking only at the diagram.  Your choices should include
      some of the open string notes, but don't let your eyes wander off the diagram
      just because you know where the open strings are.  Keep your focus
      on the note sticker for that open string while you think 
      “Right, no finger needed for that note!”
      It's a memorable feature found only in first position, so build that memory.
</p>
<h2>Playing the One-Octave Scale</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Now that you're comfortable with “finding and playing the stickers”
      it's time for a more structured assignment that's still simple enough
      to keep your eyes on the musical fretboard diagram while playing the notes.
      It's playing the one-octave scale.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/one-octave-scale.svg">
<p class="norm">
      The music above includes all the notes in the musical fretboard diagram.
      Black notes are playable in both first and seventh positions
      while the gray notes are either too low for seventh or too high for first.
      Labeled notes are the familar one-octave C major diatonic scale.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      If this music were more complicated, you'd have to keep jumping back and forth
      between it and the musical fretboard diagram to see how to play each note.
      But this scale is easy to keep in mind while still looking only at the
      musical fretboard diagram: just start with the 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
 sticker (a.k.a the red note)
      and keep going up (
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineD.svg">
 ... 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineE.svg">
 ... 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineF.svg">
 ... etc.) until you play the
      highest note in this scale (
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineChi.svg">
).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Do that a couple of times in seventh position, then switch and do it
      in first position.  When you're comfortable with that, do the scale
      starting with the high note first and end on the low note.
      This scale is so fundamental, I don't mind if you commit it to muscle memory,
      so long as you do it both positions.  But it will help if you look intently
      and purposefully at each note's sticker as you play it, because that
      visual association is literally your key when you get to sightreading.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Now that you can see the one-octave scale in the musical fretboard diagram,
      take a step back and look at the big picture it presents.
      In each position, the scale is a stack of notes starting with the red
      note at the bottom.  But seventh position is higher up the neck 
      so it's red note and the stack of notes above it are
      shifted over by about one string lower to compensate.  
      The full stack of all the black notes
      hits the basement in seventh position, while that same stack
      hits the ceiling in first position.
</p>
<h2>The Overall Learning Plan</h2>
<p class="norm">
      At this point you're able to play any of the notes in first and seventh
      position if you're looking at the musical fretboard diagram.
      But that's not sightreading.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      For sightreading, you need to be looking at the real music score.
      Looking back and forth between the score and the diagram is almost
      as bad as looking at the real fretboard.  To sightread, you need to
      know the diagram without consulting it all the time.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      In my experience, the best way to build your memory of the diagram
      is to concentrate on the location of just a few notes, and then sightread
      some real music that uses only those few notes.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      At first you may stumble a bit and your ear will alert you
      that you probably played a wrong note.  So you stop and double check the diagram,
      then go on and finish the piece.  But you don't practice the piece
      until you do it perfectly;  that's memorizing the piece instead of
      memorizing the diagram.  Instead, you go on to a fresh piece.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      After a few such pieces, you start getting more involved in playing the music
      than in finding the notes,
      and that's when you realize you've learned how to play those notes without the diagram.
      Then you can go back to the diagram and repeat this process to learn a few more notes.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Overall, that's the plan for this book.  Each chapter will add some more notes
      and provide real music that uses those new notes in addition to notes you learned
      in previous chapters.  You'll learn sightreading by sightreading.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The catch is in getting started.  Even the simplest tunes require
      about six notes.  So the rest of this chapter is to help you learn
      your first six notes as two groups of three.
</p>
<h2>Three Odd Notes to Start</h2>
<p class="norm">
      It's their position numbers within the scale that are odd: 1st, 3rd and 5th.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/ceg-triad.svg">
<p class="norm">
      We start with them because you already know the first two as the red note and,
      in position seven, the blue note.  These notes also fall on neighboring lines.
      See how nicely they stack when they're in a chord?  They also sound good together.
      They harmonize without dissonance. Together they're part of the C major chord
      you've probably already played in first position.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Your goal now is remembering how to play these three notes without looking
      at either the musical fretboard diagram or the real fretboard.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Get your guitar and go to seventh position (without looking).
      Can you remember where to play the 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
 sticker?
      We made a big deal of it being your first note in two positions.
      Even gave it a special color, red.  Try to visualize the diagram
      in your mind.  Where was that red dot?  And for that matter,
      what sticker was the blue dot on?  
</p>
<p class="norm">
      These are the things you need to remember from the diagram.
      So go back and take a quick peek at the diagram for seventh position.
      And while you're there, notice where the 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineG.svg">
 sticker is located.
      It's the third of our odd notes, so now it's important too.
      You need all three: 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
, 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineE.svg">
 and 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineG.svg">
.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Okay, if you think you've got it now, try playing this little 8-bar waltz
      that uses only those three notes.  The curved lines are phrase marks
      to help you get into the swing of things.  Think “Oom, pah, pah”.
      Begin in seventh position, then repeat in first.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/ceg-waltz.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Got it?  Now play this familiar bugle rhythm.  It's been simplified slightly
      to use only the same three notes you just learned, but it's long enough
      to keep you from peeking at the diagram.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/ceg-bugle.svg">
<p class="norm">
      That's what sightreading will feel like.  The notes keep coming
      and each one has to be visualized in the diagram until your
      fingers do the right thing as soon as your eyes fix on a note.
      It may feel like a panic at first, but it will become a joy
      the more you do it.
</p>
<h2>Three Even Notes Next</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Now we pick up the even notes in between:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/dfa-triad.svg">
<p class="norm">
      These all fit nicely together in the spaces between the lines of the odd notes,
      and these also harmonize well with each other.  As they sit together on the staff
      they look like we just moved our three odd notes up by the same amount.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      But that impression is wrong!  Our nicely stacked chord has moved up
      from C major to D minor!  Ordinarily music notation is like a picture
      or graph of how the music sounds, and it even allows immediate understanding
      of the intervals (like octaves, fifths and thirds) between most notes. 
      But it can't distinguish between major thirds (4 frets) and minor thirds (3 frets).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The fundamental reason is that the lines and spaces represent successive
      notes in the scale of natural notes, and some neighboring notes are closer
      together in pitch than others.  In this case, note 4 (an F) is only a half step (1 fret)
      above note 3 (an E), the other notes of our triads differ by a whole step (2 frets).
      So moving up from a line to a space isn't the same amount for all lines/spaces.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Realizing this may help your sightreading on guitar.  You probably noticed
      that the musical fretboard diagram often, but not always, skips a fret between neighboring notes,
      using a rest 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineR.svg">
 sticker as a separator.  This isn't haphazard.
      There are only two cases where neighboring notes have no separator.
      An F is always the next fret above an E, and C is always the next fret above B.
      Remember E-F and B-C are close and that may help when you're already playing
      one of them.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Getting back to learning these three new notes, here's an updated diagram
      showing where we are now (each chapter will have it's own such diagram
      with the same color scheme). We'll keep the one blue 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineE.svg">
 and two red notes 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineC.svg">
      as familiar points of reference, but otherwise the notes you've already learned (like 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineG.svg">
)
      will be in green, and new notes being introduced for the first time 
      will be in yellow (like 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineF.svg">
).  
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-even-three.svg">
<p class="norm">
      While you're learning these new yellow notes (
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineD.svg">
, 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineF.svg">
 and 
<img class="insvg" src="fg/inlineA.svg">
)
      it may help your memory of them in these two positions if you try to play all three
      as a chord.  Try it in seventh position.  Then in first.  Notice the difference?
      In seventh position they're on separate strings so they can all ring together.
      But not in first.  Turns out the opposite is true for our three odd notes
      (which you know from your memory of the diagram, since you already learned those notes).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Well, you know the drill by now.  Learn the three yellow notes by studying
      the diagram, then test and strengthen your memory by sightreading.
      Begin reading those notes in this version of our little waltz.
      Again, it looks very similar to the same tune for the three odd notes,
      but you'll hear the difference when you play it.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/dfa-waltz.svg">
<p class="norm">
      And here's our bugle rhythm on those same three notes, even though a real bugle
      could never play in a minor key.  Remember to play both of these tunes in
      both positions.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/dfa-bugle.svg">
<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p class="norm">
      You've reached a significant milestone in learning these first six notes.
      Now you're ready to do some real sightreading of real historical melodies.
      In fact, everything in the next chapter (Group A Exercises) uses only
      those six notes, and they're all real, historical melodies, most of
      which you'll recognize once you play them.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      To make it a bit more fun, each tune begins with a one-line riddle or hint
      that may make sense only when you recognize the music.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Now that you've graduated to real sightreading, there's another benefit.
      You won't have to read so much text, instead you'll read music at your own pace.
      Each chapter will have a diagram highlighting a couple of new notes, but 
      the rest is just music that includes those notes.

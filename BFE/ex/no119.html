<h2>Newton: Casey Jones</h2>
<p class="norm">
   An American ballad about a heroic railroad engineer who stayed on board
   a speeding locomotive, attempting to stop it before the collision
   that took his life.
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
   Come all you rounders if you want to hear,<br>
   A stroy about a brave engineer.<br>
   Casey Jones was the rounder's name.<br>
   On a six eight wheeler he won his fame.<br>
   <br>
   Casey Jones, mounted to the cabin,<br>
   Casey Jones, with his orders in his hand.<br>
   Casey Jones, mounted to the cabin,<br>
   And he took his farewell trip to that promised land.<br>

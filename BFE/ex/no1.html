<h2>American: Mary Had a Little Lamb</h2>
<p class="lyrics">
   Mary had a little lamb, ... <br>
   Whose fleece was white as snow.<br>
   And everywhere that Mary went, ... <br>
   The lamb was sure to go.<br>
   <br>
   <b>It followed her to school one day, ...</b><br>
   Which was against the rule.<br>
   It made the children laugh and play, ... <br>
   To see a lamb at school.<br>

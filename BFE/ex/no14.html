<h2>French: Ah Vous Dirai-je Maman (Twinkle Twinkle)</h2>
<p class="norm">
   You may know this tune as “Twinkle Twinkle”, but it's a French folk tune dating back to 1740. In
   1774 it was published as “La Confidence naïve” with lyrics in which a little girl confides to her
   mother about an imagined first love affair.
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
   Ah! Shall I tell you, Mama,<br>
   What causes my torment?<br>
   Ever since I saw Silvandre<br>
   Look at me so tenderly,<br>
   My heart says every moment:<br>
   Can we live without a lover?<br>
</p>
<p class="norm">
   Mozart, in 1782 at the age of about 26, wrote twelve variations on that melody, ensuring its
   popularity and survival. Despite its original association with an affair, the melody was adapted for
   multiple English children's songs, which may be why some people continue to believe Mozart
   composed Twinkle Twinkle.

<h2>For playing in two positions: I and VII</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Each exercise in this group should be played both seventh and first positions.
      Jump to seventh position without looking at the fretboard
      (remember: “first finger E on fifth string)”, read and play the exercise in seventh,
      then jump to first position and play it again. All while looking 
      only at the exercise music.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Going on to the next exercise, switch the order.  Read it first in first position,
      then in the seventh.  This alternation will share the novelty and discovery
      of sight reading across both positions (you can only truly sight read music
      once).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Once you've mastered first and seventh positions, e.g. when you're moving
      on to fifth position, you can come back to these exercises in Group A
      and play them in any of the in-between positions.
      Look for exercises with a low complexity score in a particular position.
      Technically, if it's playable in both first and seventh, its playable
      at any of the positions in-between.
</p>
<h2>Fretboard diagrams for positions I and VII</h2>
<p class="norm">
      This is how to finger the notes that positions I and VII have in common:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-i-vii.svg">
<p class="norm">
      These notes are well contained on the staff, making them easy to identify visually
      by line/space, and are common to a lot of guitar music, 
      Only two require a ledger line; one you already know as middle C
      and the other its sibling B just below (on staff and on fretboard).
</p>
<h2>Scales to practice in positions I and VII</h2>
<p class="norm">
      <b>Scale 1.</b> For your first five notes.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/scale-fifth.svg">
<p class="norm">
      <b>Scale 2.</b> The classic single octave diatonic scale (memorize).
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/scale-octave.svg">
<p class="norm">
      <b>Scale 3.</b> The octave in thirds (memorize).
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/scale-octave-thirds.svg">
<p class="norm">
      <b>Scale 4.</b> Rise and fall to each scale degree (in bold).  Takes concentration.

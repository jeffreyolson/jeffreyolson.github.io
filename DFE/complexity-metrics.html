<h1>Appendix: Position Complexity Metrics</h1>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p class="norm">
      It's no surprise that it's easier to play a particular
      piece in some positions than in others.  The goal here 
      is to quantify that observation so that students and
      instructors can make more informed choices of which
      positions are best suited for playing a particular
      exercise.  It also helps this book present the easier
      exercises within a group before the harder ones.
</p>
<h2>For Example</h2>
<p class="norm">
      We will refer to the following sample exercise repeatedly
      in this discussion.  It's short and familiar, but exhibits
      considerable variation in complexity across different
      positions.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/eg-exercise.svg">
<p class="cont">
      Notice that this exercise has zero (0) complexity
      in first position but maximal complexity (9) in the sixth
      and eleventh positions.  Even fifth position looks
      surprisingly complex (4).
</p>
<h2>Technical Setting</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Because everything in this book has been typeset in the
      Lilypond music notation language, all the music is defined
      in a plain text file, making it readily available for reading
      and analysis by other software.  For example, the music in the 
      exercise above was defined by the following text:
</p>
<!--\large-->
<!--\partial-->
<p class="norm">
      To compute metrics on such exercises, a custom Perl script
      was written to interpret the Lilypond text file and follow
      the progression of each piece note-by-note.  By looking at
      the highest and lowest notes in a particular exercise,
      the script could determine all positions on the neck in
      which that exercise could be played.  And for each such
      position, it could then figure out which combination of
      string and left-hand finger were needed to play every note.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      All that remains is teaching the Perl script what makes some
      melodies more awkward for a human hand to play, and how to
      quantify those complexities into computable measures that
      can lead to an overall complexity grade for each position
      in which an exercise is theoretically playable.
</p>
<h2>Idealistic Fingering</h2>
<p class="norm">
      While you're learning the notes in a new position, you'd
      like to choose music that allows you to keep your left hand
      essentially in the same place.  That way you can keep your
      eyes on the music without being tempted to look at your
      fingers on the fretboard.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Ideally the music would let your fingers follow the simple
      fingering pattern illustrated below, where each finger
      plays just the notes in it's own “slot”.
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/fingering-ideal.png">
<p class="norm">
      While this ideal situation is present in many of the
      exercises in this book (e.g. any diatonic exercise in seventh
      position, or any pentatonic exercise in fifth position,
      or any exercise with a complexity grade of “0”), the general
      situation is not so ideal.
</p>
<h2>Chromatic Gaps</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Anyone who has tuned a guitar using adjacent strings 
      knows there are five chromatic
      steps between most adjacent strings, so the four
      finger pattern shown above is going to leave some gaps
      in the chromatic scale.  Four, to be exact.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      For example, if you look at the notes available under the
      four fingers shown above, and follow the chromatic scale
      from the low A on the sixth string to the high C on
      the first string, you'll discover the four gaps: 
      C♯, F♯, B and G♯.
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/fingering-gaps.png">
<h2>Stretch Fingering</h2>
<p class="norm">
      To fill these four gaps, you need to stretch momentarily to the next
      higher or lower fret, as shown below.  The same notes
      are available in both places but shifted over by a string:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/fingering-stretch.png">
<p class="norm">
      Except for first position, where you get the open string
      notes for free, and the highest positions, where you
      run out fretboard, every position has exactly four
      such chromatic gaps.  And they're located in exactly the
      same relative spatial locations.  They differ only in which 
      four notes happen to be at those locations.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Even our beloved seventh position has four gaps at these
      places.  It's just
      that none of them are natural notes, as you can see below:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/fingering-stretch-vii.png">
<p class="norm">
      To fill in these chromatic gaps you have to
      go beyond the ideal fingering pattern and use the stretch
      fingering pattern shown below:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/fingering-general.png">
<p class="norm">
      This pattern applies to all positions from the second to the
      fourteenth.  It defines the default finger assignments for
      playing any melody in those positions when the goal is
      learning the notes of the fretboard in those positions.
      The chromatic gap notes shown in yellow can be played
      either in the high position with finger 4 or low with
      finger 1.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Using these fixed finger assignments as a training rule
      (“finger 3 plays all the notes in the third slot”) adds
      a helpful mnemonic when learning the fretboard at a particular
      position (“that's a third finger/slot note”) even when you
      later move on to more flexible fingerings (“hmmm, I'll have
      to use fingers 3 and 4 to play those two third-slot notes”).
</p>
<h2>Multiple Complexity Counts</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Even when you're just playing one note at a time and following
      a fixed fingering assignment, there are multiple ways in which
      left-hand fingerings can become awkward.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The Perl script counts three such sources of complexity and
      compares them to the total number of notes to get an overall
      <i>Score</i> for the average complexity per note, and then
      maps that into to an integer <i>Grade</i> on the scale from
      0 to 9, with 0 meaning zero complexity.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Here are the definitions of the various counts; examples
      are given in later sections.
</p>
<!--TODO-->
<li class="A:">{ Stretching along the neck. }</li>
<ul class="cirb">
<li class="cirb">
        when playing one of the stretch notes described above
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        adds one count for each move to a stretch note
</li>
<!--TODO-->
<li class="B:">{ Repeating the same finger. }</li>
<li class="cirb">
        when the very next note uses the same finger on a different string
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        counts the number of strings moved to get there
</li>
<!--TODO-->
<li class="C:">{ Stretching across the neck. }</li>
<li class="cirb">
        when the next note is far across the neck from previous ones
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        computes the average string number of the previous 2 notes
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        compares the difference between next string and that average
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        counts zero if the difference is 2 or less strings
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        a difference of 2.5 to 4 strings counts 1
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        a difference of 4.5 or more strings counts 2
</li>
<!--TODO-->
<li class="D:">{ Total number of note changes. }</li>
<li class="cirb">
        the denominator against which the other counts are compared
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        counts one each time the pitch changes (ignores repeated notes)
</li>
<!--TODO-->
<li class="Score"><b>= \hspace #2 ( A + B + C ) / D</b></li>
<li class="cirb">
        measures the average complexity of each note change
</li>
<!--\bullet-->
<li class="cirb">
        0 means absolutely zero (A, B and C are all exactly zero)
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        1 means less than 1 complication for every 10 notes
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        2 means 1 to 2 complications for every 10 notes, and so on
</li>
<li class="cirb">
        3 is a fairly typical grade across all the exercises
</li>
</ul>
<p class="norm">
      Although rhythm and tempo are also significant sources of
      sight reading complexity, they are issues mainly for the right
      hand and are therefore not included in these metrics aimed at
      grading positions for the left hand.
</p>
<h2>Count A: Stretching Along the Neck</h2>
<p class="norm">
      The largest discriminator between different positions is
      in how many of the notes require stretching to neighboring
      positions, i.e. Count A.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      For diatonic music in C we've already seen that positions I and VII
      never require stretching out of position, so count A will be exactly
      0 for our sample exercise in those positions.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      We also expect that position V will require a stretch
      to reach the B in the middle of the staff, and indeed our
      example shows count A being incremented by 1 on those two notes:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/eg-measA-posV.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Position VI has the worst reputationin the key of C with
      all four of its chromatic gaps on natural notes: low D, G, C
      and high A.  But only two of those notes (G and C) are present
      in our example. Notwithstanding, there are still 10 counts in
      this small example.  Note that the repeated eighth notes
      only increment on their leading note, since the algorithm
      looks just at changes in left hand fingering.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/eg-measA-posVI.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Thus far count A is clearly showing its preference for positions
      I and VII (count = 0) compared to position V (count = 2) and
      position VI (count = 10).
</p>
<h2>Count B: Repeating the Same Finger</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Besides stretching out of position, the next biggest hassle
      of playing a melody in a fixed fingering pattern is when
      the same finger has to carry the melody to a different
      string on successive notes, i.e. Count B.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Although it didn't matter to count A whether a stretch was to
      the higher position (finger 4) or the lower position (finger 1),
      those finger number differences can affect count B, as we'll
      see below.  In such cases the Perl script always assumes
      for simplicity that the stretch uses finger 4.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      That turns out not to affect count B when our sample exercise
      is played in position V.  You can see below that all the
      counts in this case are traceable to G, C and E all being
      played by finger 1 on the fifth fret, without stretching.  The first count
      is when going from G to C, the second is going the other
      way, and the last two are from E to C.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Obviously this is a good example of why experienced guitarists
      don't adhere to rigid fingering assignments.  They'd handle this
      small complexity with a bar or roll of the first finger, or a 
      scrunch with another finger. But count B is here to warn
      the student that this complexity exists.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/eg-measB-posV.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Even though the two instances of a B note in the above example
      are stretches for position V, they don't contribute to count B
      in this case regardless of which finger, 1 or 4, is used. In
      both instances they follow a C being played by finger 1, so
      obviously it doesn't count if finger 4 is used on the B
      (not the same finger).  But even if finger 1 is used for both
      the C and the B, the fact that they are on the string means
      there is no string jump and the result is still no count B.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      When our exercise is played in position VI (below), G and C are
      now stretch notes (ambiguously finger 1s on fret 5 
      or finger 4s on fret 10) while B and E are
      not (they're definite finger 4s on fret 9).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      In this case, the stretch note ambiguity matters somewhat.  It
      doesn't affect the transitions between G and C since they're
      on adjacent strings at the same fret whether the stretch goes high
      or low. But it does affect the transitions from E to C since
      E is finger 4 either way but C is not.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/eg-measB-posVI.svg">
<p class="norm">
      You might notice that the sequence of four notes (G C B G)
      around the B half note
      are all assumed to be played by finger 4, yet the count
      increments only twice.  It doesn't increment when going
      from C to B because that's a simple slide on the same string
      (zero string jump).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      This example also demonstrates that count B is incremented
      when the same finger stretches to a different fret.  That happens,
      assuming we stretch low with finger 4, in the transition
      from B to G (9th and 10th frets) and from E to C (also on
      the 9th and 10th frets).
</p>
<h2>Count C: Stretching Across the Neck</h2>
<p class="norm">
      A melody can gradually walk from one edge of the fretboard
      to the other without inconveniencing the player, but large
      jumps across are another matter, hence Count C.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      In our example, the octave jump up to high G gets one count
      in positions where those notes are three strings apart,
      as is the case in position VI below, but not in position V
      where they are only two strings apart.

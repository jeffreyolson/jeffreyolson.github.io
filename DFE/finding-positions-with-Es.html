<h1>Finding Positions With Ease (E's)</h1>
<p class="norm">
    None of the exercises in this book requires changing position
    along the neck during a song.  But most of these exercises can
    and should be played in more than one position.  And all the
    exercises in the first chapter should be played in two
    positions, first and seventh.  So how do you find seventh position
    without looking at the fretboard marks or counting frets?
</p>
<p class="norm">
    There is an easy trick for finding positions without looking,
    so you should learn it right at the outset as you start to
    learn position seven.  The same kind of trick even works for
    other positions.
</p>
<h2>Finding Seventh Position</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Seventh position, by definition, is where your hand is located
    when your first finger is comfortable playing notes on the
    seventh fret.  If your hand is in the right place, then most
    of the notes played with the first finger are exactly an octave
    above the next lower open string, as shown below:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/position-seven.png">
<p class="norm">
    So the <b>E</b>asy way to verify that you are in seventh position
    is to play that E on the fifth string with your first finger, then
    compare that sound with the low E on the open sixth string.  If you're
    in the right place, the octave will be in tune.  If it's not, move
    higher or lower to make it in tune.
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/finding-seven.png">
<p class="norm">
    Just remember (as part of your fretboard learning) that 
    “first finger E in seventh position”
    should match octaves with an open E string.  Of course this trick
    wouldn't be used when changing to seventh position in the middle of a piece,
    but it's perfect for switching between first and seventh positions
    when replaying the exercises in the first chapter (Group A).
    And it can also be used at the beginning of a piece in a public
    performance; people will assume you're just checking your tuning
    (they're used to hearing E's in that context).
</p>
<h2>Finding Fifth Position</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Same trick but on the second string: 
    “first finger E in fifth position.”
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/finding-five.png">
<h2>Finding Ninth Position</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Same trick but on the third string: 
    “first finger E in ninth position.”
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/finding-nine.png">
<h2>Finding Second Position</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Same trick but on the fourth string: 
    “first finger E in second position.”
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/finding-two.png">
<h2>Finding First Position</h2>
<p class="norm">
    First position is a little different.  Because the first finger
    is right next to the nut, all of the first finger notes are just
    half step away from an open string so they don't match any
    open strings.  Of course you don't need the tuning trick to
    verify first position since your first finger can simply reach
    out and touch the nut.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    But the tuning trick still works with E's if you just use your
    <i>second</i> finger to verify the position: 
    “second finger E in first position.”
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/finding-one.png">
<h2>Finding Other Positions With E's</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Like first position, you can still use E's to locate all the other positions, 
    but not using your first finger.  It happens that sixth, eleventh
    and thirteenth positions all have a second finger E, but you won't
    be using those positions much in this book based on
    the key of C.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    The diagram below shows all possible open string matches in case
    you're curious about other possibilities besides E's.
</p>

<h2>Finding Third Position With G's</h2>
<p class="norm">
    When you think of third position, the note G should immediately
    come to mind, and it's on the first finger, so use G on
    either the first or sixth string to locate third position:
    “first finger G in third position.”
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/finding-three.png">
<h2>Finding Fourth Position With B's</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Likewise, when thinking of fourth position, the poor lonely B
    on the third string should come to mind, so use it to locate
    fourth position (it will feel better to be used and will
    appreciate being remembered):
    “first finger B in fourth position.”

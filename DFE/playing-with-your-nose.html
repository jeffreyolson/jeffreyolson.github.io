<h1>Playing With Your Nose</h1>
<p class="norm">
    No book on guitar technique would be complete without
    attention to proper body position. The literature on this
    subject contains many fine descriptions concerning proper
    placement of the fingers, thumb, wrist, arm, shoulder and
    even the feet, but scarcely any mention the nose, proper
    placement of which is essential in sight reading and in 
    developing the habits of polite posture for public performance.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Mothers say “Keep your fingers away from your nose!  It's disgusting!”
    To which we would add the corollary “Keep your nose away from
    your fingers!” (same reason).  If you are sight reading, you've got
    to keep your nose in the music, not on the fretboard.  Attempting to
    alternate between the two is an invitation to losing your place in the
    music. And if you practice with your nose on the fretboard,
    you will surely perform with your nose on the fretboard.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    We don't have enough noses on which to count the number of times
    we've attended concerts where esteemed guitarists appear to have
    their noses glued to the fretboard as though by some sticky
    colloidal substance.  Disgusting!  Evidently such esteemed guitarists
    never developed good sight reading habits (which would have kept
    their noses off the fretboard) nor listened to their mothers.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Let us cement this image (please forgive) with the well known though
    possibly apocryphal story of how the young Beethoven would challenge
    his friends to play five C's simultaneously on the piano.  At an age
    when their hand spans could scarcely reach one octave much less 
    two, all they could manage using both hands was four C's.  The trick
    Beethoven reportedly showed them, was to play the fifth C with
    the nose, as illustrated below:
</p>

<p class="norm">
    There is an analogous story, though less well known and more
    possibly apocryphal, of how Beethoven played six C's on the guitar.
    We use this story to cement the image (again forgive) that (a) there is
    at least one C on every string of the guitar, and (b) the one
    on the sixth string is special.  Here is Beethoven's solution
    on the guitar (in the diagram, “i” and “m” on the right hand 
    denote the index and
    middle fingers, respectively; strum with “p”, the thumb):
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/lvb-six.png">
<p class="norm">
    You can now and forevermore remember the C at fret 8 on string 6 (the only
    C on the sixth string) as the sticky spot where Beethoven played
    his sixth C on guitar.  In fact, it is also middle C on the guitar,
    being one of exactly two places on the fretboard for this note
    (the other is on the fifth string and labeled LH 3 in the above
    diagram).  Look again at the diagram and realize that you now also
    know where the only C is on the <i>first</i> string; like Beethoven's
    sixth C, it is at fret 8 because (as you know) both the first and
    the sixth strings are tuned to open E's, two octaves apart. So a
    C on the first string is at the same fret as a C on the sixth string.
    Let these C's stick (forgive again) in your memory.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    While the present author heartily recommends playing
    Beethoven on guitar (it's beautiful), <b>Thou Shouldst Not</b>
    play guitar like Beethoven (it's disgusting).  So always keep your
    head up with your eyes on the music whenever you sight read or
    practice.  Otherwise your performances will look like you're
    playing with your nose.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    <i>Coda</i>: Mothers also say “Use a handkerchief!”  At least
    some of the aforementioned offending guitarists can be seen to
    carry a handkerchief onstage in their performances, no doubt
    to wipe off the fretboard around Beethoven's sixth C.

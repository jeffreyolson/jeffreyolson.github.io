<h1>Musical Fretboard Diagrams</h1>
<h2>Ordinary Fretboard Diagrams</h2>
<p class="norm">
      You may have seen fretboard diagrams like the one below that show
      where the notes are on a guitar fretboard.  This one shows just the
      natural notes and blacks out all the sharps and flats,
      making it look like a crossword puzzle in a strange language.
      But it has all the diatonic notes in the key of C, so it should be
      just what you need to play all the diatonic melodies in this book,
      right?  
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/ordinary-fb.png">
<p class="norm">
      Wrong!  While diagrams like this may be good for <i>talking</i> about
      the fretboard and the spatial relationships between notes,
      they're insufficient and maybe even detrimental for <i>reading music </i>
      on the fretboard.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The biggest problem is that such diagrams only show the locations of
      notes on the fretboard, not the locations of those notes on
      the staff.  Instead of solving the main problem (mapping music on the staff
      into locations you'll remember on the fretboard), they replace it
      with two problems (naming the notes on the staff, and then locating
      those names on the fretboard), the first of which is not addressed at all,
      and the second of which is done incompletely (it doesn't show
      which octaves are which).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      A more subtle yet insidious problem is that ordinary fretboard
      diagrams may give you
      the notion of actually looking at your guitar's fretboard 
      while playing, rather than visualizing it in your mind's eye.
      You see a lot of guitarists with this bad habit, which is tough to break.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      When you're sight reading and see a note on the top line of the staff,
      you need to know immediately where to place your finger on the fretboard in 
      whatever position you are along the neck.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      There is no time to
      recite “Every Good Boy Does Fine” to figure out it's an F,
      and you clearly can't be reciting the alphabet starting from the
      well known open string tunings.  There's not even time simply
      to think that in position VII this F is finger number 4
      on string 3.  But in position V it's finger 2 on
      string 2.  Or in position I it's finger 1 on string 1.
      No, no, no.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      You need to train your brain to associate location on the staff
      immediately with location on the fretboard in a particular neck position.
      This is purely a right-brain spatial operation without thinking
      about the digit “4” or even the letter “F”.
      Those are left-brain crutches that will just slow you down.
</p>
<h2>The Fretboard in Music Notation</h2>
<p class="norm">
      The following “diagram” solves
      these problems by using music notation to illustrate the
      location of notes on the guitar fretboard. It looks like the notes
      you'll read on the staff,
      but it's arranged spatially like the fretboard, so you can train
      your brain (and fingers) to know where to play those notes on the fretboard.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Here's how this “music” represents the fretboard.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The six “staves” correspond to the six strings, and the three
      “measures” correspond to positions I, V and VII, which together
      cover all the natural notes on the neck below the twelfth fret.
      Focusing on position I, the first “beat” on each staff shows
      the notes of the open strings, each labelled conventionally
      as finger zero (0).  The next three beats show the next natural
      notes on successive frets, or a rest where the note at that
      fret would be a sharp or flat.  The “lyrics” below the staff
      give the note names that you  should sing aloud when learning
      these notes.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      In the standard fingering pattern for any position, the first
      finger usually takes the notes on the first fret (or “slot”) of that
      position, the second finger plays the second slot, and so on.
      Position I is special because you get open strings at the
      zeroeth fret for free and only need three fingers to cover
      the remaining natural notes in the scale.  Position VII, our
      other sweet spot, is also special in that all the natural
      notes of the scale in that range fit into the four slots, so
      they are easily covered by the four fingers in the standard
      pattern (note how the finger numbers align in vertical columns
      corresponding to beats 1 through 4).
</p>
<h2>Reading the Musical Fretboard</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Let's read the diagram to see how to play this note of music:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/mdlc.svg">
<p class="norm">
      <i>Start by looking at the music </i> (above) and identify where that note
      is located relative to the staff.  In this case, it's on the first ledger line
      below the staff. 
      <i>Next, look for that same note in, e.g., column VII of the diagram </i>
      (circled below):
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-c-vii-fingers.svg">
<p class="cont">
      (This copy of the musical fretboard diagram has been condensed to save space
      by eliminating all the note letter names and fingering numbers,
      but it still has everything you need to find that circled note on your guitar.)
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Now, <i>read the row and slot where that circled note is located within the diagram. </i>
      Verically, it's in the bottom row, on the staff marked &#9317 meaning it's
      played on the sixth string.  Horizontally, it's in the second of
      the four finger slots in the position VII column.  
      That means in seventh position you'd 
      <i>play it on the sixth string with your second finger. </i>
      That would be on fret 8, since your first finger is lined up with fret 7.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      So get out your guitar and give it a try.  Move your left hand into position VII
      (i.e. with index finger positioned to play on the seventh fret
      and your other fingers ready to play on the eighth, ninth and tenth frets).
      Then use your second finger to play the
      sixth string at fret 8.  That's your note in position VII!
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Now let's find that same note when playing in position I:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-c-i-fingers.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Position I is special because the first of its four slots is
      for the open strings, so it only takes three fingers to cover the
      remaining slots.
      In this case, our circled note in first position tells you that you'd 
      <i>play it on the fifth string with your third finger, </i>
      i.e. on the third fret, since your first finger is lined up with fret 1
      when playing in first position.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Try playing that that note now on your guitar in first position,
      placing your third finger on the fifth string, like in the diagram.
      You should hear the same sound as when you played it before in
      seventh position.
</p>
<p class="norm">
        That's how you <i>read</i> the musical fret board to play
        a note you see in music notation.
        And you found how to play it without even needing to know
        the name of that note, but by <i>seeing</i>
        its location on the staff and its location(s) in the diagram.
</p>
<p class="norm">
        Turns out that note is called “middle C” and you just learned
        the only two places you can play that note on the guitar.
        If you're sharp and noticed that this note is also
        shown the diagram in the position V column, you'll realize
        that the diagrams for positions V and VII overlap, so it's
        really the same place on the sixth string (fret 8) but played with different
        finger slots in different positions (5-6-7-8 in position V
        but just 7-8 in position VII).
</p>
<h2>Your Most Important Guitar Lesson</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Congratulations and condolences!  You have just learned your most
      important lesson in sight-reading music on the guitar: 
      that there is more than one way to finger the same musical note,
      and you need a way to choose between them when sight-reading
      a piece of music.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      This is different than many other instruments.
      When a kid in a band learns to play saxophone,
      there is just one way to play middle C, and most of the other notes too.
      They can safely memorize where to put their fingers for each note
      without later having to “un-memorize” fingerings to play in a different range
      of their instrument.  Even baritone, tenor and alto saxophones use
      basically the same fingering charts, so middle C always uses the same fingers.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The guitar is more challenging.
      As you've seen, you can play middle C on two different strings, making it reachable
      from eight hand positions along the neck, and each position will have its own
      fingering for that same note.  There are even two notes 
      (on the typical 19-fret classical guitar)
      that can be played on five different strings in 15 positions
      with 15 different fingerings.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The musical fretboard diagram makes all this manageable by recognizing
      that just two or three positions/fingerings are enough to cover all
      the natural notes below the twelfth fret.  Positions VII and I are
      especially easy because the whole diatonic scale across those positions
      can be played  without stretching your fingers beyond the four natural
      slots.  Position V is a close runner up with only one note (B)
      requiring a stretch.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      In fact, these three positions shown in the diagram are so well
      self-contained that you'll be playing entire scales and songs
      without changing positions.  Turns out, there are more notes available
      to you going <i>across</i> the neck in one position than there are
      going up the entire fretboard on any one string, even on a 24-fret guitar.
      And it's much easier to reach quickly across the fretboard than it
      is to move your hand the full length of the fretboard.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      But the most important part of your most important lesson is that 
      <i>you need to learn at least two positions simultaneously </i>
      in order for your brain to handle
      multiple positions.  It has to learn from the outset
      that <i>every note on the staff requires a context, </i>
      like what position your hand is at, before it can tell your fingers
      where to play it; just like your middle C experience.
      You need to be fully aware of the context/position
      in which you're learning, and the way to force that awareness
      is to start your learning in two contexts/positions and switch
      back and forth between them.  Play the song in one position
      and then in the other.  This book is organized for you to do that.
</p>
<h2>Watch Where You're Looking</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Probably the next most important lesson is what you do with your eyes
      when learning the musical fretboard, or when sight-reading anything.
      DON'T LOOK AT YOUR FINGERS.  EVER.  Your eyes will busy on the music,
      so your fingers must learn to work on their own.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      So before picking up your guitar again, start by trying this little
      finger touching exercise WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED. Hold up your fretting hand as though 
      playing an “air guitar” and touch each finger in succession 
      to your thumb.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/fingers-to-thumb.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Easy, huh?  Even with your eyes closed.  Now pick up your real
      guitar and, WITH YOUR EYES STILL CLOSED, do the same thing
      at any position where you happened to grab the neck;
      i.e. play the four notes in the slots at that position, and practice
      changing to neighboring strings and repeating.  
      Teach your fingers to find the strings and slots 
      in a given position without any help from your eyes.
</p>
<h2>Find Position VII Without Looking</h2>
<p class="norm">
      But what about looking in order to change positions?
      For this book, the answer is still NO!
      None of the pieces in this book requires a change in position while playing.
      All you need is to find your starting position,
      and that can be accomplished without looking by using your ears.
      There will more on this topic later, but here's how to do
      it for position VII.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Pick up your guitar and get ready to play, BUT CLOSE YOUR EYES 
      (after reading this step in the instructions, of course).
      Play the open sixth string, and maybe also the open first string.
      They're the same note two octaves apart and should sound in tune together.
      Now use your <i>lefthand index finger </i> to fret a note about two thirds of the way
      up the neck <i>on the fifth string. </i>  If that note sounds
      in tune with the open first and sixth strings (i.e. the octave in between),
      then your index finger is right on the seventh fret.
      If it doesn't match, move up or down on the fifth string until it does.
      Then you can open your eyes.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      You should use this trick to verify position VII every time,
      after first having taken your best guess at moving there silently.
      Your body has a way of knowing where your hand is (without looking)
      and police officers use this to gauge drunkeness (“Close your eyes
      and touch your nose.”).  Eventually your position guesses will improve.
</p>
<h2>Learning the Musical Fretboard</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Now you're ready to <i>learn</i> the music fretboard.
      Obviously you're not going
      to consult the diagram note-by-note through a song while
      sight reading.  Instead, you're going to study (and remember by sight) parts of
      the diagram that will allow you to play those notes immediately in any song
      you choose to read.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Let's set the goal of being able to sight-read this little tune
      in positions VII and I
      without ever taking your eyes off it; not to look at the fretboard,
      not to place your fingers, not to switch positions,
      not even to consult the diagram while you're sight-reading.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/tune.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Instead of trying to memorize the whole musical fretboard diagram
      for two positions, we'll start with the minimum needed for this piece.
      Look at the range of notes in this tune, from low to high.
      It starts with the note you already learned, middle C, which is also the
      lowest.  The highest is a few notes later; the one in the space
      just below the middle of the staff.
      That's the range we'll learn first.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      To learn these notes in position VII, 
      focus on the lower right corner of the musical fretboard diagram.
      Recognizing the high and low notes by their appearance, we identify
      the range of notes we want to learn (circled below).
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-detail-c-a-vii-fingers.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Pick up your guitar and move to position VII without looking
      (as you learned in the previous section: finger 1 on string &#9316
      until it's in tune with open string &#9317 ).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      With your eyes focused intently on the circled
      notes, find and play the lowest one, the middle C you found before.
      Remember how?  Read the string (&#9317 ) and the slot (second)
      where that note is located on the diagram, and move that finger to that string
      and play the note.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Go on to the next higher note in the diagram, the one just below the
      lowest line of the staff.  Still the same string but in the fourth slot.
      Play it with your fourth finger.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The next higher note in the scale is on the next string; we're going across
      the neck to follow the scale without changing position.  
      String &#9316 slot 1; play the note.  This is the tuning note you
      played before to verify you were in seventh position.  Remember
      what it looks like on the staff (on the lowest line).
      You may also be ready to remember that this note is an E, just like the
      tuning of the open sixth and first strings.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      This is where you should be committing these fingerings to memory. 
      You may want to go back and forth on just these three notes, 
      in any order you choose to play them, noticing how they look on the staff
      every time you place your finger to play them.  It will sink in.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Let's also look at how these same notes are fingered in position I.
      Here is the relevant portion of the musical fretboard diagram for these notes.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-detail-c-a-i-fingers.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Right away you notice again that only three fingers are needed in this position
      because of help from the open string notes, labeled above with a “0”.
      You should also notice that these are not the same strings as in position VII;
      when you shift to a lower position, the notes will be more toward the
      high side of the fretboard.  Another difference is that the index finger
      has no notes to play here; in this part of the diagrm,
      it's all second and third fingers 
      plus the open strings.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      By now, you're probably so used to reading which fingers to play
      that you could play this scale of six notes just by reading the diagram
      (and without looking at your fingers!).  Give it a try.  Stare at the diagram
      while you're doing it and let it guide you.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The work here, however, is to form memorable associations about these notes
      and where they are located in this position.  Two of them are open strings,
      so you already know their names: D and G (in the “0” column).
      Middle C you already met, and the note after D is the same E pitch you met
      when finding position VII with your first finger.  But here in first
      position that E is played with the second finger.  So you might remember
      “second finger E” as a way to verify you're first position.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      If you've ever played chords in first position, there are two common
      chords present in these six notes.  Use your second and third fingers to play
      the E and middle C, respectively, then also play the open G (remember which one?).
      These three are located on neighboring <i>lines</i> of the staff, starting with middle C.
      That's a C major triad.  Play them together, or in succession as an arpeggio:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/cegtriad.svg">
<p class="norm">
      The other chord is made from the other three notes of our six,
      and they are in neighboring <i>spaces</i> on the staff, starting with D.
      In this position, two of them are on the same string here, so you have to play them in sequence.
      Start with the D (open, remember?). In the music, it's hanging in the space just below
      the staff.  Our other two that go nicely with this D are on the next two spaces
      in the staff, so you have to skip over the E line and the G line to get to them
      on the staff.  Similarly you skip up the strings, but by different amounts.
      Coming after E and G, those notes are named F and A.  Together with the D
      they make the D minor triad.  Play them in succession to hear this simple
      minor triad:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/dfatriad.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Now go back to seventh position (remember “first finger E in seventh position)”
      where you can play these same two triads.  Only now it's the D minor triad that 
      you can play all at once (try it: D F A) while the C major triad has to be
      played like an arpeggio (middle C E G).  The notes are still in the same
      place on the staff, of course, even though they're at different fingerings.
      But you're dealing with that, right?
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Congratulations!  You've just now played the same music (the two triads)
      in two different positions on the fretboard.  And the notes of those two
      triads are a useful way to remember the names of the lines and spaces
      in this part of the staff.  Now you've got friends in this neighborhood
      (major CEG and minor DFA) that you will meet again and again as you
      read more music.
</p>
<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Here again are the notes you've learned how to play on the diagram:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-c-to-a-i-vii.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Now play our little tune, starting in seventh position (and get there without looking!).
      While focusing on the first note in the music 
      (and without looking at your fingers or the fretboard)
      start by remembering which slot middle C is in when you're playing
      in seventh position.  Try to remember what you learned from the
      musical fretboard diagram without looking at it either, unless you get stuck.
      This is the real test of what you've learned.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/tune.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Also play this tune in first position, now that you undoubtedly
      recognize the old French melody as “Ah Vous Dirai-je Maman”
      as popularized by Mozart's variations in 1782.  No?  Then perhaps in English
      as “The Alphabet Song” (1835) or “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep” (1744).
      No? Oh, yes, then perhaps as “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” (1806).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      If at first you don't succeed (and even if you do), try again tomorrow.
      You're building biological connections within your brain when you
      memorize something, and that takes time and reinforcement.  
      Be patient with yourself; this is a significant leap in learning
      the fretboard, as you can see from all the circled notes on the diagram.
      But it's knowledge that will last you a lifetime.
</p>
<h2>Position V</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Any music that you can play both in first and seventh positions can
      also be played in fifth, but maybe not as conveniently.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      The B note
      at the middle line of the staff is not available in any of
      the four slots of the standard pattern in position V, so you
      either have to stretch finger 4 higher on the fourth string
      or finger 1 lower on the third string to play this “extension note.”
</p>

      On the other hand, once you've learned seventh position you
      already know where over half of the notes are in fifth position,
      since the upper half of fifth overlaps with the lower half of seventh,
      although with different fingers.
</p>
<h2>Position VI</h2>
<p class="norm">
      The worst positions
      for the key of C are positions VI, VIII and XI, each having the
      maximum of four extension notes.  When you play in those
      positions, the extensions scream out that you should just
      move to one of the neighboring positions.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-vi.svg">
<p class="norm">
      You can see this
      in the diagram above for position VI, where fingers 1 and 4
      are mostly stretching outside of their assigned slots.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      For any extension note you always have two choices:
      finger 1 can stretch lower on the neck or finger 4 can stretch higher up the neck;
      player's choice.  The changing space between frets means
      stretching low is farther than stretching higher.
      But finger 1 is usually longer and stronger than finger 4.
      Well, there's another choice: move to a neighboring position.
</p>
<h2>A Diagram for All Positions</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Once you're used to playing confidently in seventh and first positions,
      you'll be ready for other positions.  At first, each new position
      may feel like playing a different instrument with different fingerings.
      But as you begin to play in positions that overlap with your comfort zones,
      it will get easier and easier to play in other positions, if the piece is suitable.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      That's when this “unified” diagram may prove helpful as a reference
      (i.e. <i>after</i> you've already learned the main positions).
      It shows all the natural notes on the neck, from the open strings
      though the 13th fret, and has markers at all the odd numbered positions.
      This allows you to visualize playing at any position along the neck.
</p>

<p class="norm">
      For example, to see the fingering extensions needed for third position, imagine
      playing the four finger slots beginning at the III (i.e. frets 3 through 6,
      as shown in the diagram below)
      and visually follow the scale up from the lowest note (string &#9317 slot 1).
      Find the subsequent notes either by the note names in alphabetic order
      or by the rising notes positions relative to the staff, alternating
      spaces and lines.  The answers are circled below, revealing three extension notes
      that require stretching one way or the other.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/musfb-uni-iii-fingers.svg">
<p class="norm">
      Notice that there is never an extension note between strings
      &#9313 and &#9314 in this or any other  position, 
      since the tuning difference between
      those two strings only amounts to 4 frets, which is always
      covered by the 4 slots of any position.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      Now imagine, using the diagram above with all the circles,
      what it would be like to play in second position.
      Move the fingers down (i.e. left) one fret and see how much
      better the circles line up with the slots.  
      You should see only one extension note, the “f”, between strings
      &#9312 and &#9313.  The three extensions we had
      in third position are now handled by the first finger in second position.

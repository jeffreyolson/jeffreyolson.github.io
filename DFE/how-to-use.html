<h1>How to Use This Book</h1>
<h2>Sight Reading Materials and Methods</h2>
<p class="norm">
      “Diatonic Fretboard Exercises” (DFE) and its sequel
      “Chromatic Fretboard Exercises” (CFE) together provide
      a wealth of sightreading material from over a thousand
      public domain sources collected over eight years, 
      all arranged for playing in multiple positions
      on guitar and graded by computer so that you can develop
      your knowledge of the fretboard gradually, while
      you have some fun trying to identify the music
      before peeking at the answer.  Even experienced
      sightreaders can get hooked into playing just one more piece.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      But there is also a distinct method in all this material,
      and it addresses the fundamental challenge of sightreading
      on guitar: there's more than one way to play the same note.
      Other books begin with training you in first position:
      you see a note on the staff and remember how to play
      it in first position.  But when you go to another position,
      you have learn that there's now another way to play that note.
      So some of the memory that let you play smoothly in first position
      has to be un-learned in order to add another position.
      Seeing a note in the music isn't enough to information
      to know where to play it.
</p>
<p class="norm">
       In this book, you will begin by learning each new note in two
       positions, first and seventh, so your memory is being built explicitly
       on the context of where your hand is located, not just on the appearance
       of the note on the staff.  It's like being taught by bilingual parents:
       you can converse equally well in both languages, instead of the
       second language seeming like a foreign language.
</p>
<p class="norm">
       Thanks to computer analysis on this wealth of material,
       you will find a steady progression of music that is playable
       in both of those starting positions.  And when you venture outside
       those positions, every piece will indicate all the other positions
       in which it playable, and even the difficulty of doing so.
       These books are all about learning in parallel positions even in
       chapters labelled for a single position.
       Just as there's more than one way to play a note,
       the computer shows when there is more than one position in which to play a piece.
</p>
<p class="norm">
       But not one of these pieces is generated by computer or from random notes.
       Every piece of music is a real historical melody, many of which will sound
       familiar to you; and that's what helps you realize if you play a wrong note.
       You may mot know the piece but you'll probably know if you play it wrong.
</p>
<p class="norm">
       Another innovation in this method is the use of “Musical Fretboard Diagrams”
       when you are learning how to play the notes.  Instead of the usual diagrams
       you see (like the one on the front cover of this book) where spots on the fretboard
       are identified by a letter like “C” (with no indication of whether it's
       middle C or high C), you'll be seeing the actual appearance of the
       note on the staff for that spot on the fretboard.  That way you build your visual
       recognition of notes on the staff while you are building your memory of where to play them.
</p>
<p class="norm">
       Other features of this method are ways to find positions on the neck without
       looking at the neck, but by listening to particular tuning notes that
       match open strings when your hand is in the right position
       (see “Finding Positions With Ease (E's)”).
       Plus there are lots of other stories about the fretboard that help you
       remember a few odd notes, like where Beethoven played his sixth C 
       (see “Playing With Your Nose”), or Poor Middle B
       in fifth position, or Ludicrous B as the highest note
       (in “Hairy Notes Outside the Staff”).
       These silly stories can make some long lasting memories to help your sightreading
       by making it personal.
</p>
<h2>Music Notation</h2>
<p class="norm">
      These books assume you are comfortable with basic music notation and simple rhythms.
      That you can understand the notes; you just can't find them on the fretboard fast enough
      to sightread on guitar, particularly in the higher positions.  
</p>
<p class="norm">
       Actually, in this method, you don't even need to know the names of the notes on 
       the lines and spaces of the staff.  You'll visually recognize the placement of
       a note on the staff and know spatially where to place your finger on the fretboard
       to play it, thanks to the Musical Fretboard Diagrams.
</p>
<p class="norm">
       Getting the rhythms right can still be a challenge, even for experienced sightreaders.
       But knowing <i>when</i> to move your fingers is different than knowing <i>where</i> to move them.
       You may find that you learn how to read rhythms from playing enough notes to
       recognize a familar melody where you already know the rhythm.  Once you recognize
       the piece, you can study how the notation was writing its rhythm.
       It's something you can learn from experience.
</p>
<h2>Left Hand Focus</h2>
<p class="norm">
      These initial books in the series are all about finding 
      notes on the fretboard while looking straight at the music; they
      encourage you to focus on your left hand, for now, without ever
      actually looking at it. Yes, your right hand's ability to sound the
      notes and play the rhythms will get a workout, but these exercises
      are aimed at the left hand.
</p>
<h2>One Note at a Time</h2>
<p class="norm">
      To keep everything else simple while you're learning the fretboard,
      all the pieces are strictly monophonic melody lines; no polyphonic voices nor
      even any chords.  This also maximizes the number of positions in
      which each piece can be played and allows an objective grading of
      the comparative difficulty of those positions.
</p>
<h2>One Position at a Time</h2>
<p class="norm">
      The aim of this book is to cover the entire fretboard, but not in
      any one exercise.  The pieces have been edited, where necessary, so that 
      each melody will fit within the range of an individual position of
      four adjacent frets. You may have to stretch to an adjacent fret
      to get a missing note, but your left hand can remain in one position
      for the entire exercise, which means your eyes can remain on the
      music and there's no excuse for looking at the fretboard.
      You're still encouraged to play the same piece in multiple positions;
      but you'll never have to change positions in the middle of piece.
</p>
<h2>Diatonic in C</h2>
<p class="norm">
      In this beginning book of the series, all the pieces are simple
      diatonic melodies in the key of C (or A minor), in order to
      focus on learning the natural notes first.  There are no sharps or
      flats, and no accidentals in this book.  Those colorations are
      introduced in the next book, “Chromatic Fretboard Exercises”.
</p>
<h2>Familiar Melodies</h2>
<p class="norm">
      All of the music consists of melody lines, mostly familiar, derived from
      various public domain sources.
      The simple diatonic melodies in this first book draw heavily from
      traditional nursery rhymes, children's songs, Christmas carols and
      folk songs, as well as some themes from classical music.
      Their familiarity helps you  recognize if you play a wrong note,
      as long as they're not so familiar you start playing by ear.
      Because of editing for playability, there is no assurance
      of authenticity relative to the original sources.  And not every
      melody will be familiar to you.  Thus, you still
      need to play by sight.
</p>
<h2>Hidden Titles</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Exercises are identified only by number; all the titles have
      been relegated to the index in the back, meaning you have to
      sight read the music carefully just to know what it is, 
      rather than playing by ear based on the title.
      Look up that exercise by number in the Exercise Index or,
      in the web edition, hover the cursor in the blank area at the top
      of each music page to reveal its title.
      So read the music
      and have fun guessing the tune while you're at it.
</p>
<h2>Sweet Positions</h2>
<p class="norm">
      You learn quickly that certain positions on the neck are better 
      suited to playing in the key of C than other positions.  The 
      sweet spots are at positions I and VII (i.e. with first finger
      of the left hand at the first or the seventh fret, respectively).
      Those two positions are unique in that you can play all the 
      natural notes in that range without ever having to stretch your
      left hand into a neighboring position. And position VII has the
      added bonus of being more compact than position I, making it even
      easier, especially for smaller hands. So that's where this book
      starts.
</p>
<h2>Starting With I and VII</h2>
<p class="norm">
      This book is organized into groups of melodies that are playable
      in particular positions, allowing you to match your sight reading
      practice with the positions where you are still learning the 
      notes on the fretboard.  Group A has melodies in the 13 note
      range that can be played in both positions I and VII, and
      therefore also at all the other positions in between, though
      with more effort.  This is to encourage you to learn positions
      I and VII simultaneously from the start.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      By becoming equally at home in 
      these two simplest positions, your brain adjusts naturally to the notion
      that there is more than one way to play a given note on the
      guitar, making it easier for you to learn additional positions;
      the same way that bilingual children don't grow up thinking
      of other languages as “foreign” languages.  And learning just
      these 13 notes in positions I and VII means you will have
      learned 62&percnt; of the 42 natural notes on the neck below the 12th
      fret (and you already know the notes at the 12th fret).
</p>
<h2>Progressing to Other Positions</h2>
<p class="norm">
      After Group A's emphasis on what is common to positions I and VII,
      the next two groups focus on what is different.  Group B has
      melodies reaching the 4 low notes that are playable in position
      I but not VII, and Group C conversely has melodies touching the
      4 high notes playable in position VII but not I.  In terms of
      progress, adding Group B puts you at 71&percnt; of the neck and Group
      C at 81&percnt;.  Next, Group D introduces 8 new notes in position V,
      filling the gap between positions I and VII, thereby bringing
      you up to 100&percnt; of the neck below the 12th fret!  Finally, Groups
      E and F cover the high end of the fretboard with positions IX and XII.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      But you don't have to follow this particular progression if you
      and your instructor have other plans.  The annotations and gradings
      described below can help you chart your own path across the fretboard.
</p>
<h2>Grading the Positions</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Each exercise in this book is annotated
      with a list of all the positions in which that exercise is playable,
      along with a grade on the scale from 0 to 9, with 0 being the
      easiest and 9 the most awkward, of how easy it is to play that
      exercise in that position.  The positions are indicated by Roman
      numerals and the grades follow in Arabic numerals, as shown below:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/exercise-metrics.svg">
<p class="norm">
      If you are
      just starting, look for the 0's (meaning absolutely no stretching)
      and 1's (meaning no more than about 10&percnt; of the notes are awkward
      to finger).  More experienced readers may choose to play each
      piece in all its listed positions.  Others may look for just
      the single position they're learning at the time (e.g. most of
      the position II pieces can be found in Groups A and B).
</p>
<h2>Single String Playing</h2>
<p class="norm">
      You can also use this book to learn notes one string at a time,
      instead of one position at a time (both are valuable skills).
      If a particular melody is playable in it's entirety on a single
      string, each such string number is circled at the end of the
      list of playable positions, just as though the string itself
      were a kind of position.  
</p>
<p class="norm">
      For example (as shown above) we see that Exercise 1 can be played
      entirely on string &#9314 or entirely on string &#9315.
      Melodies such as this with a narrow range of notes
      often have more than one such string on which they are playable,
      in which case the lower numbered string is generally the easiest.
</p>
<h2>Ambitus Marks</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Each piece also employs a musical marking called an <i>ambitus</i> to
      the left of the clef sign indicating the highest and lowest notes.
      Such markings are more common in vocal music, so a performer can
      know at the outset whether the piece is within their vocal range.
      Here it gives the student/instructor a quick way to see if a
      piece is within the range of notes that are under study for a
      particular position.  In general, a narrow ambitus is also another
      indicator of an easier piece.
</p>
<h2>No Fingering Marks</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Because these exercises are intended to be played in multiple
      positions where different fingers would be used to play the same
      note, there are no explicit fingering marks in any of these
      exercises. Instead, you should try to use “standard position
      fingering” where finger 1 covers the first fret of whatever position
      you're at, finger 2 covers the 2nd fret, and so on.  See the
      examples given in the next section on “Musical Fretboard Diagrams”.
</p>
<p class="norm">
      When your sight reading skills improve past just getting the notes
      and into recognizing chord arpeggios or following phrases, you'll
      need to move beyond standard position fingering, but at least you'll
      have the habit of using all four fingers.
</p>
<h2>Mental Exercises</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Finally, about that word “Exercise”.  Although this book follows
      the convention of listing each piece as a numbered exercise, the
      exercises here are intended to be read once and forgotten, not
      memorized and repeated.  These are not finger exercises for
      muscle strength or dexterity.  They're mental exercises to
      test and develop your recognition of notes on the staff and
      your knowledge of their locations on the fretboard.
</p>
<h2>Flash Card Tests</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Think of each new note you see as a miniature flash card test:
      as soon as the note flashes into view, you move your finger to
      play the sound, your ears tell you if you get it right, and the
      whole time your eyes are fixed on the note, thereby programming
      the entire sensory experience (eyes on note, fingers on fretboard,
      sound in ears, pleasure of success) into your vast neural network
      (brain).
</p>
<p class="norm">
      If you're going to learn to sight read, you must play
      each note by sight, not by recalling the tune. As soon as you find yourself
      knowing the next note without looking at the staff, stop!
      You are no longer sight reading.  Worse yet, if you find
      yourself looking at the fretboard instead of the music, your
      fingers will quickly learn to be guided by your eyes instead
      of by their sense of touch and spatial position.  Vision easily
      dominates our other senses, so watch where you're looking!
</p>
<h2>Do Not Practice</h2>
<p class="norm">
      Do not practice these exercises, otherwise you'll be learning
      the test rather than testing your learning.  Just move on to
      the next exercise or a different position on the same exercise.
      That's why there are so many of them.
      This book has 1200+ exercises from 500+ different melodies, 
      and the next book, Chromatic Fretboard Exercises, is just as big.
      You should have no shortage of fresh sight
      reading material and no need for repetition.

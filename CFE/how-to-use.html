<h1>How to Use This Book</h1>
<h2>Read the DFE First</h2>
<p class="norm">
    “Chromatic Fretboard Exercises” (CFE) is a sequel and a companion
    to “Diatonic Fretboard Exercises” (DFE).  The intent is that
    the DFE be used first, to learn the natural notes on the fretboard
    especially in positions I and VII, before using this book to add
    sharps and flats.  The explanations in the DFE also apply here,
    so be sure read “How to Use This Book” in the DFE before starting
    with the CFE.
</p>
<h2>Like the DFE ...</h2>
<ul class="dotb">
<li class="dotb">
    The CFE is for learning to read music over the whole
    fretboard while looking only at the music.  The emphasis
    is on guiding the left hand without looking at it.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Working knowledge of music notation is assumed,
    but you'll still be able to play the notes you see even
    if you don't know their names.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    The pieces are all public domain melodies in the key of C, 
    playable on the guitar
    without changing hand positions along the neck, so there is no excuse
    for looking at the left hand or the fretboard.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Titles are hidden to encourage identification by
    sight reading rather than playing by ear or memory. 
    Look up that exercise by number in the Exercise Index or,
    in the web edition, hover the cursor in the blank area at the top
    of each music page to reveal its title.
    This also provides the fun reward of solving a puzzle each time
    a familiar tune reveals itself.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Exercises are grouped by the positions in which they are
    playable, and the first chapter encourages learning positions
    I and VII at the same time.  Later chapters go up the neck
    until the whole fretboard is covered.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Difficulty grades are provided for each playable position of
    every piece, to encourage playing the same piece in a variety
    of positions and learning from experience why some positions
    are easier than others.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Single string playing is supported.  A circled number at the
    end of the list of playable positions indicates that piece is
    playable in its entirety on that string.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Ambitus markings are included at the start of each piece
    indicating the range of notes for that piece, which is an important
    factor in choosing a position.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    No fingerings are marked, since different positions
    require different fingerings.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    The “Exercises” are not to be practiced or even repeated.
    Each one is a fresh opportunity to test your sight reading
    ability.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    At the back of the book there's an Exercise Index ordered by
    exercise number to identify a piece you're playing, and a Name
    Index to locate exercises by name of the piece or of the composer/nationality. 
    To help you learn more
    about the original music, the References section has links
    you can follow to the freely available source scores.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unlike the DFE ...</h2>
<ul class="dotb">
<li class="dotb">
    The CFE introduces accidentals (sharps or flats within a measure
    that persist for the remainder of that measure, or until
    the next natural sign).  Every piece in the CFE will have
    at least once accidental.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Chromatic means each piece ventures outside the 7 note diatonic scale
    and into the 12 note chromatic scale, though less so for some
    pieces than others.  Chromatic does not mean each piece includes
    a run up the chromatic scale.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    The wider chromatic palette makes the music more colorful and
    varied. Selections draw less from nursery rhymes and children's
    songs, and much more from well known classical pieces and some
    exotic sounds from other cultures. 
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Colorful pieces tend to be longer.
    On average, CFE exercises
    are about twice as long those in the DFE and, as a result,
    tend to be playable in fewer positions.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    Colorful pieces have more rhythmic variety.  Reading rhythms
    is not the subject of this book, but it is a consequence.
</li>
<li class="dotb">
    A wider palette also means you may have to stretch farther to
    reach those new notes.  Difficulty grades tend to be higher
    in the CFE
    and the differences between positions are not so dramatic
    as in the DFE
    (the “sweet” positions like seventh position are no longer quite
    so sweet).
</li>
</ul>
<p class="norm">
    All of this makes the CFE both more challenging to play 
    and more rewarding to hear than the DFE. 
    This book has over 1100 exercises from 500+ melodies.
    Most exercises are playable in several positions, resulting
    in several thousand distinct workouts.
    Your gray matter will get planty of exercise!
    Enjoy!

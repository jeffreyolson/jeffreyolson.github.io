<h1>Coloring the Notes</h1>
<h2>How and Why</h2>
<p class="norm">
    This brings us to the rationale used in coloring the 
    notes on that first page diagram.  Unlike purely graphical
    coloring schemes, e.g. where the colors of the chromatic
    scale might follow the colors of the rainbow in spectral
    order, the rationale for this scheme is musical.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Colors are assigned to groups of notes that are related
    musically by the sounds of their diatonic triads,
    i.e. major, minor and diminished. Doing it this way turns
    out to reveal some surprising relationships among notes
    on the fretboard and their order in the circle of fifths.
    And understanding these musical patterns will
    help you see the fretboard in your mind's eye
    without looking at it.
</p>
<h2>Sounds of the Diatonic Triads</h2>
<p class="norm">
    If you recall the DFE section on “The Notes in Black and White”,
    playing diatonic music in the key of C is like playing only
    the white keys of a piano (the “natural” notes).  But despite
    the equal widths of those keys on a keyboard, the musical interval between
    adjacent notes varies, which makes starting an octave scale
    at a different point sound different, thus producing the
    seven “modes” of classical Greek music (C-Ionian, D-Dorian,
    E-Phrygian, F-Lydian, G-Mixolydian, A-Aeolian and B-Locrian).
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Those unequal intervals (some half steps instead of whole steps)
    also make simple chords sound different when starting at
    different points in the scale.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    For example, a triad (first, third and fifth notes in the 
    sequence) based on C produces a major chord (C-E-G) while
    a triad starting on D produces a minor chord (D-F-A).
    The triad at A (A-C-E) is also minor but the triad at B
    (B-D-F) is unique in being diminished (distinct from minor
    since the fifth as well as the third are flattened compared
    to a major triad).
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Here are seven diatonic triads in the key of C.
    They all look alike on the staff, and all are played alike
    on the piano by simply shifting the hand up the keyboard
    by one note. Yet they don't sound alike, nor are they played
    alike on the guitar, where you have to consciously flat
    the third to make a minor.  Play them and listen:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/seven-triads.svg">
<p class="norm">
    These triad sounds are worth remembering as fundamental consequences
    of our basic diatonic scale.  And they are also the basis for
    remembering our fretboard coloring scheme.
</p>
<p class="cont">
    basic diatonic scale.  And they are also the basis for
    remembering our fretboard coloring scheme.
</p>
<h2>Color Scheme Mnemonics</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Because minor triads often feel dark or “bluesy”,
    we choose the color Blue for the three notes
    with minor triads:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tiles-blue-minor.png">
<p class="norm">
    Because major triads often feel bright, the opposite of bluesy,
    we choose the color Red for the three notes with major triads:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tiles-red-major.png">
<p class="norm">
    Because diminished triads often feel unresolved or incomplete,
    we choose the color Green for the one note with 
    a diminished triad:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tiles-green-dim.png">
<p class="norm">
    Thus, the 7 natural notes occupy the basic “RGB” colors.
    For the remaining 3 sharps and 2 flats we choose some 
    secondary colors.  The sharps, being close to the red notes,
    are colored Orange:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tiles-orange-sharps.png">
<p class="norm">
    And flats are purple:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tiles-purple-flats.png">
<p class="norm">
    Listing these color tiles in the order of the chromatic
    scale may look like a random jumble:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tiles-chro-scale.png">
<p class="norm">
    But look at what happens when they are listed in the order
    of rising fifths, like on the circle of fifths:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/tiles-chro-fifths.png">
<p class="norm">
    Like colors are all grouped together, and major (Red) 
    minor (Blue) and diminished (Green) follow in sequence
    flanked by the flats to the left and the sharps to the right.
</p>
<h2>The Circle of Fifths</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Some guitarists may think of the circle of fifths as 
    an old diagram from music theory that tells how many
    sharps or flats are in each key signature.
    True, but here the focus is on learning the list of fifths.
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/cof-standard-view.svg">
<p class="norm">
    At least memorize
    the seven natural notes in order of fifths: say “FCG” then
    “DAE” plus “B” (repeat: “FCG” then “DAE” plus “B”, again:
    “FCG” then “DAE” plus “B”). 
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Now look for “FCG” and “DAE” on the fretboard below. You 
    should find three FCGs and four DAEs (counting the open
    strings). But they're not always together, e.g. the 
    “DAF” in tenth position.  So what gives?
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/all-notes-in-b-and-w.png">
<p class="norm">
    It will help to see the circle in full color, 
    as in the next diagram.  Here, the circle
    has been rotated a bit to put our favorites on top
    (repeat: “FCG” then “DAE” plus “B”) with the sharps and
    flats below.  It also names the sharps and flats
    in the way that's more familiar to guitarists.
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/cof-colored-circle.png">
<p class="norm">
      But to really see the circle of fifths on the fretboard,
      you need to split the fretboard visually between the second 
      and third strings (because of their closer tuning) and
      imagine little “dogleg” lines connecting the two parts
      with an offset of one fret (to follow a perfect fourth).
      Then think of our colored circle of fifths as a
      loop of beads that can be cut and draped across the fretboard,
      following that little dogleg path.  Do you see it now?
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/cof-one-bead-string.png">
<p class="norm">
    If you start at other notes along the first string, you will
    still trace out notes in the order of the circle of fifths.
    They will just be different parts of the circle, as shown below:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/cof-two-bead-strings.png">
<p class="norm">
    The same is true no matter where you start on the first string.
    Every note in the chromatic scale is in the circle of fifths.
    So the nineteen frets on the first string (for a standard classical
    guitar) lead to a total of nineteen
    circles of fifths on the fretboard, as shown below:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/cof-all-nineteen-strings.png">
<p class="norm">
    When you think of the fretboard this way (with the split and
    the doglegs) the sequence is always “FCG” then “DAE” plus “B”
    (repeat: “FCG” then “DAE” plus “B”, again: “FCG” then “DAE” plus “B”).
    Without exception.
</p>
<h2>The Circle of Fourths?</h2>
<p class="norm">
    You might ask why the circle of fifths appears on the fretboard
    considering that a guitar is tuned mostly in fourths, not 
    fifths. There are many equivalent answers, all of which are
    useful.  Because the sequence of <i>ascending fifths</i> is the 
    same as the sequence of <i>descending fourths</i>. 
    Because fourths and fifths are complementary: a fourth plus
    a fifth equals an octave.  Because inverting a fifth produces
    a fourth, as shown below:
</p>
<img class="svg" src="fg/fifth-and-fourth.svg">
<p class="norm">
    In the first chord, the C and the higher G are a fifth apart
    (the G is a fifth above the C and the C is a fifth below the G).
    In the second chord, the C and the lower G are a fourth apart
    (the G is a fourth below the C and the C is a fourth above the G).
    If this sounds confusing, it's because the same C is being
    compared to two different notes named G, an octave apart.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    So the circle of fifths (ascending) is also a circle of fourths
    (descending). Thus, as you descend fourths by going to lower
    strings on the fretboard (following the doglegs) you always
    get the same sequence as ascending fifths, i.e. as though
    you were going clockwise around the circle of fifths.
</p>
<h2>The Fretboard as Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p class="norm">
    If you know your fretboard better than your music theory,
    you can turn this relationship around in case you can't remember
    the circle of fifths.  Our mantra of “FCG” then “DAE” is built
    right into first position and the open strings, which you surely
    cannot forget:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/cof-partial-cheat-sheet.png">
<p class="norm">
    Here's an example of using your fretboard to figure out
    sharps and flats in a particular key.
    Knowing that the key of C has no sharps or flats, you add sharps
    as you go down (clockwise around the circle) to the next keys: 
    G, D A and E. Going the other way from C (i.e. up, or 
    counterclockwise) you add flats.  So the key of A has three
    sharps and the key of F has one flat.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Need the other six parts of the circle of fifths?  After
    “FCG” then “DAE” you know that “B” is next (from the mantra).
    So that set of six is available starting with the B in seventh
    position. And there's another “FCG” then “DAE” even higher up:
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/cof-full-cheat-sheet.png">
<h2>Friendly Fourths and Fifths</h2>
<p class="norm">
    Another reason to know your fourths and fifths, is that
    nearest neighbors on the circle of fifths get along better
    with each other (fourths and fifths are more harmonious) than notes that are 
    diametrically opposed (tritones and semitones are more dissonant).  So, depending on
    genre, odds are good that nearest neighbor notes are likely
    to appear in the same piece.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    In the key of C major, for example, the common I-IV-V chords
    in old rock and roll have roots C-F-G, where F has the role
    of fourth.  Of course, F is also a fifth below C and “FCG”
    is a group of nearest neighbors on the circle of fifths.
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/fifths-red-FCGs.png">
<p class="norm">
    Regardless of all that theorizing, remembering that “FCG” appears
    together on the fretboard is something your brain can handle
    while reading music. At least in the case where you're already
    playing one of those three, you'll know that its friends are nearby.
    So even if you don't have absolute knowledge of every F, C and G,
    just having relative knowledge of their proximity can help.
</p>
<p class="norm">
    Likewise, in the key of A minor, which also appears a lot in
    these exercises, the I-IV-V pattern leads to the “DAE” neighbors
    on the circle of fifths.  So knowing that these friends like to
    congregate may help you in your sight reading.
</p>
<img class="png" src="fg/fifths-blue-DAEs.png">
<p class="norm">
    Of course, you also have to keep in mind whether you're straddling
    the “split” in the fretboard and compensate accordingly.

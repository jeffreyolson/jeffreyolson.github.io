No meeting this month because the last Monday of the month is actually December 25th.
But Jeff nonetheless has a handout that you can pick up in January, or download it now from his site.
</p>

<p class="wrds">
<a href = "Dec2023.pdf">This month's sightreading</a>* goes back to the year 1582
when a book was published with medieval music from hundreds of years earlier.
To get you in the mood, the exercises in this issue are written in old mensural notation
without any measure bars or time signatures.  The notes look like they're in a strange font,
but they're similar enough to modern notation to be playable.  Plus there's
a rosetta stone on the back page showing how to translate mensural to modern notation.
</p>

<p class="wrds">
Exercise 1 was actually a hit song in the 1970's by the British folk rock group Steeleye Span
despite being in Dorian mode (you'll want to see the youtube).  Curiously, the 1582 publication did not provide music for
the verses, and the modern versions have copyright issues, so Jeff wrote a new melody
for that part.  The fascinating history of this issue is the subject of an 
excellent recent video by Early Music Sources (see link on the back).
</p>

<p class="wrds">
The other two exercises also came from that 1582 book, but you'll recognize them right away
because the melodies were reused in some 19th century British carols.

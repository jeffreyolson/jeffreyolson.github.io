<p class="wrds">
If you enjoyed our Ensemble Night in January, then you'll have fun with <a href = "Mar2024.pdf">this month's sightreading handout</a>* where the two "exercises" are actually the two guitar parts to one short little duet (34 seconds).
</p>

<p class="wrds">
On hearing it, most people recognize the theme on which this duet is based, but not perhaps by its original title.  It's the fifth variation in Mozart's Twelve Variations on <i>Ah Vous Dirai-je Maman?</i>, an eighteenth century French tune that translates roughly as "Oh! Shall I tell you, Mama?" in which a little girl confides to her mother about an imagined first love affair.
</p>

<p class="wrds">
Usually a theme is stated before its variations, but six years ago when Jeff arranged all twelve of Mozart's variations for guitar duo, he changed the order to delay recognition of the theme (a bit like Benjamin Britten's variations on a Dowland theme).  A link to that complete work on IMSLP is on the back page, if you're looking for more guitar duets.
</p>

<p class="wrds">
So, can you recognize the theme by reading this variation?  Hint 1: play Exercise 1 alone and leave out the rests.  Hint 2: the size of the star at the top of this month's fretboard graphic.

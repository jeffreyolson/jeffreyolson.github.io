The green leaves of summer are finally upon us, so this month we celebrate <i>La Folia</i>, a 500-year-old chord progression that has been used in hundreds of pieces.  Corelli and Vivaldi have famous examples, Sor did several variations, Bach has but one, and Beethoven slipped just 8 bars of it into the second movement of his 5th symphony.  Certainly you've heard a folia.

More recently, the song coincidentally named <i>The Green Leaves of Summer</i>, written for The Alamo starring John Wayne and sung by the Brothers Four, began with the first 5 bars of the progression.  Vangelis, famous for his <i>Chariots of Fire</i>, used the whole progression with his own melody for the movie <i>1492: A Conquest of Paradise</i>.  Even the pop song <i>Oops!... I Did It Again</i> sung by Britney Spears has the progression in its chorus!

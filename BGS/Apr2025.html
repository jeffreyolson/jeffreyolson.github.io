Well-known but not well-liked.  The first exercise in
<a href = "Apr2025.pdf">this month's sightreading handout</a>* about tulips became famous in the late 60's and early 70's mainly because of who sang it as their signature song.  But the song itself goes back another 40 years to 1929, which means it just entered the public domain in 2025.  And this definitely is the month for tulips in Boulder.

The other exercise this month is also about tulips but is much less well-known.  Curiously both exercises are in (tulip) cut time and both are similarly syncopated.  Perhaps it's because of how the word "tulip" fits into the lyrics.  You could say they're "tulip syncopated", but now you're used to sightreading syncopation after last month's exercises.  Right?

Remember to get the PDF version of this handout so you can click on the youtube urls to hear these relics of the past, even if they're not well-liked.  They are sooo dated.  Click it and try it!

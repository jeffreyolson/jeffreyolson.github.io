   <div class="titl">Sightreads for Groundhog Day(s)</div>

<p class="wrds">
Come again? And again.  And again.  Thanks to Bill Murray's 1993 movie, it seems to never end;  groundhogs just keep popping up.  There's Punxsutawney Phil in Pennsylvania, Buckeye Chuck the woodchuck in Ohio, and Flatiron Freddy the marmot right here in Boulder.  People have been using hibernating animals to predict spring for centuries, going back to the 1500s in Germany where the bear was the forecaster.  That history is believed to be why the song says "the bear went over the mountain, to see what he could see."

It's a stretch, but
<a href = "Feb2026.pdf">this month's sightreading handout</a>*
has three exercises related to Groundhog Day.  No, you won't be sightreading <i>"I Got You Babe"</i> (1965) that played on the radio every morning in the movie to announce it was still Groundhog Day again.  Nor even Rachmaninoff's <i>"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini"</i> (1934) that Murray eventually learned to play on piano.  Both of those are still under copyright.
</p>
<p class="wrds">
Here the first exercise is an obscure song Beethoven wrote to lyrics by Goethe.  You won't recognize it or the lyrics, but it's an easy sightread in several positions with a pleasant tune.  The other two exercises are major and minor variations by Sor on a very old theme.  You <i>will</i> recognize the tune in the major one, and the minor one sets the mood in case there's six more weeks of winter (in a normal year).  If you don't get the association, read the back page for an explanation.  There's more to Groundhog Day than just groundhogs!

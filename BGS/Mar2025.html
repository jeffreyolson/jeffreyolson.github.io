<p class="wrds">
Did you spring back after having to spring forward this spring?  Changing to Daylight Saving Time can be especially disorienting to your daily rhythm.  Things just seem to be "off" for a while, but eventually it feels normal.
</p>
<p class="wrds">
In sightreading, following the written rhythm can be a challenge, but running into some syncopated sequences can be similarly disorienting.  Initially it may throw you off, but once you get in sync it can be refreshing and even fun.
</p>
<p class="wrds">
<a href = "Mar2025.pdf">This month's sightreading handout</a>* is all about syncopation, with examples from Vivaldi and Joplin.  Both exercises have those short-long sequences that wake you up when sightreading and force you to pay attention.  And just for fun, a third exercise converts Joplin's short-longs into long-shorts on the same melody, making his lovely syncopated waltz into a straight 6/8 piece that sounds like child's play (The Farmer in the Dell?).  It underscores how important reading rhythms can be.  Spring forward and give it a try!

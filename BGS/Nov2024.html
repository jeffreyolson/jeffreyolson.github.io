   <div class="titl">Sightreads in D Dorian</div>

<p class="wrds">
For the historically gray skies of November we switch to the typically austere sound of Dorian mode, which, in the key of C, means starting the scale of white notes with D, making that the new tonic.  It's not quite the same as D minor (Aeolian mode starting at D) because that would require a black key (B flat).  On the fretboard above, the usual decorations on the nine C's have shifted up two frets, and a tenth has been added on the open string.  Dorian is different.

<p class="wrds">
<a href = "Nov2024.pdf">This month's sightreading handout</a>* has two exercises in Dorian mode: a Gregorian chant (c.1270) and a much more recent sea shanty (c.1820).  The old chant's message of mortality and retribution is so disturbing, its music has been quoted for that effect by numerous classical composers and horror movies.  Yet it also has a mesmerizing softer side, witness its use in Disney's <i>Frozen II</i>, and its soothing effect when played legato on guitar.  Its simple rhythm and playability in three positions make it a good sightread.  Try it!
</p>
<p class="wrds">
The second exercise is a lively well-known tune that you might not have realized is Dorian.  Its simple repetitive lyrics have stimulated tons of creative punishments for misbehaving sailors, soldiers, skippers and others, including some modern news makers (like the Exxon Valdez).  It's another easy sightread, and both exercises can also be played solely on the fifth string (a fun challenge!)..

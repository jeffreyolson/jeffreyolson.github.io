<p class="wrds">
Sweethearts come in pairs and 
<a href = "Feb2025.pdf">this month's sightreading handout</a>* has two.  One, a declaration of devoted love that's been a jazz standard for nearly a century (only becoming public domain now in 2025), and the other, a sweet song that people may remember their (great)grandparents singing to each other.
</p>
<p class="wrds">
Both are very easy in first position and quite readable in seventh position.  But if you'd like to break out of playing in fixed positions, both of these songs are also playable in their entirety on single strings.  That's a completely different sightreading experience that really enforces awareness of musical intervals and arm position.  Humans (and most other animals) have sensory neurons in their muscles, tendons and joints that tell the brain where the extremities are positioned (see the Wikipedia article on 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">Proprioception</a>).  It's the basis of the drunk-driving test where you touch your nose while your eyes are closed.
</p>
<p class="wrds">
So try sightreading Exercise 2 entirely on the D string, where it ranges between frets 2 and 15.  When successive notes are close together, remember that E-F and B-C are on adjacent frets while whole-step intervals skip a fret.  For big jumps, like coming down from E (which you know is D at the 12th fret plus a whole step, so fret 14) down to G (at the 5th fret), aim to play the G with your middle finger and estimate where the target is (without looking).  If your middle finger lands in the wrong spot (your ears will know), then quickly adjust by using a neighboring finger.
</p>
<p class="wrds">
The good news is that you have the physiology to get better at this.  Start relying upon your proprioceptors to move to the right spot and upon your ears to verify it's the right note, rather than looking at the fretboard.  Only don't expect this to work if you're under the influence!

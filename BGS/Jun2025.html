   <div class="titl">Sightreads Unfit for Weddings?</div>

<p class="wrds">
<a href = "Jun2025.pdf">This month's sightreading handout</a>* features four melodies often heard at weddings. You’ll recognize each one of them as you play, so you’ll know right away if you hit a wrong note. 
</p>
<p class="wrds">
But if you know the stories behind these tunes, you’ll wonder why most of them are ever chosen for weddings.  The bride dies in two of these stories, the groom also dies in one and two lovers commit suicide in another.  Only one of the four has a story fit for a wedding. Play all four and guess which one it is!
</p>
<p class="wrds">
P.S.  If you have friend or family member who is planning a wedding, you might suggest they check Wikipedia before finalizing their choice of music.

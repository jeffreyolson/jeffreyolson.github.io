In case you missed the October meeting where Jeff Olson handed out his first Monthly Sightreader with some scary music for Halloween,  you can now get the PDF from his web site.  You may know that for seven years he's been collecting and arranging public domain melodies for guitar sightreading, and now he's got over a thousand.
</p>

<p class="wrds">
While he's still doing the finishing touches on the whole collection (to be published on IMSLP), he has started preparing these little one-sheet handouts specifically for BGS, each with a colorful fretboard and a couple of topical tunes matching the theme for that month.  As in his books, the titles of the melodies are not shown on the page with the music, so you play the music to guess the title.  But the back of the sheet has titles plus lots of fun trivia about each one,  typically including web links to Wikipedia and Youtubes of performances.
</p>

<p class="wrds">
Since he couldn't draw a recognizable turkey the size of the October bats, the theme for
<a href = "Nov2023.pdf">this month's sightreading handout</a>* is the "No!" in November. 
It has three tunes, each with "No" in the title.  
Download the PDF so you can follow the links on the back with just one click.
</p>

<p class="wrds">
So take a look and try it out.  Maybe you'd even like to play one of the little tunes during the meeting?

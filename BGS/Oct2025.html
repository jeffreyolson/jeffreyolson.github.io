<p class="wrds">
The face in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream">"The Scream"</a> 
may bear some resemblance to the face of your guitar, but that's dwarfed by the similarities between 
<a href = "Oct2025.pdf">this month's sightreading handout</a>* 
compared to the 
<a href="Oct2023.pdf">first ever BGS sightreading handout</a>+.  
That old handout featured some scary Halloween music composed by a 19 year old Russian pianist back in 1892, while the main piece this month was composed for guitar by a 39 year old Spaniard, also back in 1892!
</p>
<p class="wrds">
Classical guitarists will recognize this month's piece even if it's not in their personal repertoire.  The challenging original ranged over almost the entire fretboard with drop-D tuning, but its melodic reduction for this sightreading fits comfortably in first position with standard tuning, making it enjoyable to play as a simple sightread.
</p>
<p class="wrds">
Its similarities to that scary Russian piece have gone unrecognized, until now.  Space on the handout didn't permit including the full versions of both sightreads, so this month's Exercise 1 compares just the first line from the Russian piano piece with the last line from the Spanish guitar piece.  Exercise 2 is the full guitar piece sightread.  Follow the Oct2023 link below to see the full Russian sightread.  Both are a pleasure to play.

         <h2><a href="BFE/index.html">Beginning Fretboard Exercises</a></h2>
         <p>
            A gentle introduction to sightreading the same pieces in both
            first and seventh positions.  For children of all ages.
            The identity of each piece (exercise) is a riddle
            that you solve mainly by playing the music.

         <h2><a href="DFE/index.html">Diatonic Fretboard Exercises</a></h2>
         <p>
            A compendium of over 1200 simple exercises arranged for guitar sightreading,
            compiled from 500+ public domain melodies that were analyzed by computer to provide
            a graduated sightreading program covering all the natural notes on the fretboard.
            A method with lots of music plus some humor (see "Playing With Your Nose").

         <h2><a href="CFE/index.html">Chromatic Fretboard Exercises</a></h2>
         <p>
            A second compendium of over 1100 more challenging exercises 
            that cover the entire fretboard, including sharps and flats.
            Most exercises are playable in multiple positions, with computer grading
            of their difficulty in each position.  A wealth of great historical
            melodies to broaden your perspective and keep your sightreading sharp!

            performances on the back.
